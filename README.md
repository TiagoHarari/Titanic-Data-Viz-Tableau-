# Titanic Data Visualization Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset through data visualization using **Tableau**. The goal is to identify key trends and insights from the Titanic passenger data, such as survival rates based on different variables (age, gender, class, etc.).

## Project Files

- `titanic_visualization.twb`: This is the Tableau workbook that contains the instructions for generating the visualizations. To modify or explore the interactive dashboard, you'll need to open this file using Tableau.
  
- `titanic_visualization.pdf`: A PDF export of the visualization. This file contains a static version of the dashboard that can be viewed without Tableau.

- `titanic_visualization.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation with the visualizations. This is useful for presenting the insights in a structured format.

### Tools Used

- **Tableau**: To create interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
- **PowerPoint**: For presenting the insights derived from the visualizations.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing (Data cleaning).
- **Kaggle**: Dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## How to View the Visualizations

1. **PDF Version**: Open the `titanic_visualization.pdf` file to view the static visualizations without the need for Tableau.
2. **PowerPoint Version**: Open the `titanic_visualization.pptx` file to see the visualizations in a presentation format.
3. **Tableau File**: If you wish to interact with the data and the visualizations, download Tableau (free version available) and open the `titanic_visualization.twb` file.
